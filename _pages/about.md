I am a PhD candidate in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan, where I am a part of the [LIT research group](http://lit.eecs.umich.edu/), supervised by [Dr. Rada Mihalcea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/).

My research interests include natural language processing, machine learning, computational social science, word embeddings, word semantics, and data science. Currently, I am working on a project analyzing the stability of word embeddings.
