            <h2>This course is an introductory course to artificial intelligence. The purpose of this course is to provide an overview of this field. We will cover topics including: agents, search, planning, uncertainty, and learning. The goals of this course are to provide a fundamental knowledge of the field. The course evaluation will include homework, a midterm, and a final.
            </h2>

            <h2>The goal of this course is to provide background in the field of artificial intelligence. The successful student will finish the course with specific modeling and analytical skills (e.g., search, logic, probability), knowledge of many of the most important knowledge representation, reasoning, and machine learning schemes, and a general understanding of AI principles and practice. The course will serve to prepare the student for further study of AI, as well as to inform any work involving the design of computer programs for substantial application domains.</h2>

            <h2><i>Winter 2021, Fall 2022</i></h2>

            <h2>Engineering 101 focuses on using your computer to solve engineering problems through computer
                programming. Many engineering problems involve repetition -- getting data and doing the same
                calculations over and over again. Automating this process, using computing programming, saves time and
                minimizes errors in these calculations. Engineers have more and more data to work with in the design
                process, so developing computer programs is now a part of almost every modern engineering project.</h2>

            <h2>Our goal is that you leave this course with experience in logically breaking down a large problem into
                smaller problems that are more easily solved and with an appreciation for how critical computer
                programming is for <i>all</i> engineering disciplines.</h2>

                our class time will be spent programming and problem solving collaboratively. We will also have a the
                chance to interact with visiting researchers and computing professionals, as well as visit a local CS

            <h2>This course provides an introduction to the theory and practice of natural language processing
                (NLP) - the creation of computer programs that can understand, generate, and learn natural

                pragmatics. The course will introduce both knowledge-based and statistical approaches to NLP,
                illustrate the use of NLP techniques and tools in a variety of application areas, and provide
                insight into many open research problems.</h2>
